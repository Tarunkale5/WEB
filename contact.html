      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Let’s start by clarifying what we are not. We are not just another brand. We are not just an idea.
Rowdy is a way of life; an undeterred spirit ready to take this world by a storm.
To rebel is a thing of the past. We get Rowdy! Rowdy Wear is symbolic of this spirit. It is a manifestation of the Rowdy within.
      Since we don’t play by the rules, we decided to create something that is equally unconventional and that compliments us. Inspired by street-style and sculpted to imperfection, Rowdy Wear is a range of clothing that helps pick the Rowdies apart in a crowd full of mundane.</p>
